**searchGPT** is an open-source project to build a search engine based on Large Language Model (LLM) technology to give natural language answers.

You may consider that this is a **minimal implementation of new Bing mainly for search engine and question answering**. 

It supports using sources like the Internet and supports file content search.

Please give me a star if you like it! ðŸŒŸ


### Installation

1. Create your python or anaconda env and install python packages

Native
```
# using python=3.10.8
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Anaconda
```
conda create --name searchgpt python=3.10.8
conda activate searchgpt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Input API keys (OpenAI/Azure Bing Search) in `src/config/config.yaml` (or using UI)
3. Run `app.py`, (or `flask_app.py`) for frontend web app launching. `main.py` for stdout output only.
